Evil corporation's taken over.
People have cell phones biologically coupled to them

Why are you killing people?
===========================
Because they're out to stop your quest

What is your purpose?
=====================
To free the human race from the evil megacorporation (don't forget the mega) TeRoBell

Why are these enemies attacking you?
====================================
They are employees and executives of the Terobell.  They need to stop your "evil" plan!

Additional Ideas:
=================
- AoE damage radius
- Enemies take "damage" by losing numbers
- Objectives: assassination, certain number of enemies
- Accuracy bonus
- Projectiles from enemies that have numbers themselves
- Powerups (bombs, speed, health, kill one random enemy)
- Powerdowns (no service)
- Animals (lions, tigers, bears, oh my!)
- Obstacles (cars, dumpsters, office tables)
- Mounts! (level, evolve, ride! training ui!)
- Autopause when numlock is off

Movement:
=========
- 800x600
- 3x3 boxed area
- endless waves of enemies
- get points by killing enemies
- get high score
- you die when you get hit once
